## Rule-interposing deep reinforcement learning based energy management strategy for power-split hybrid electric vehicle.[DOI](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0360544220304047?token=B70E6384D7093CAEC7BC9C8D4E005696F260B15D5BC83F0E1349CD2D82DE1F5111D6000746121629006098B3A4FF2BB5) & [Code](https://github.com/lryz0612/Deep-reinforcement-learning-based-energy-management-strategy-for-hybrid-electric-vehicle)

* A rule-interposing deep reinforcement learning based energy management system is proposed based on a state-of-art DRL algorithm, DDPG; 
* Aiming at the fuel economy and learning efficiency of DRL-based EMS, the embedded knowledge is utilized to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and the simplification of large control space; 
* Extensive comparative simulations with respect to rule-interposing (RI) DDPG-based EMS and RI DQL-based EMS are conducted and discussed in detail.

## Cross-type transfer for deep reinforcement learningbased hybrid electric vehicle energy management

 * A  novel  framework  of  DRL-based EMS  combined  with  TL  is  proposed  based  on  a  state-of-art DRL algorithm, DDPG. 
 * In contrast to previous studies that only target to handle the EMS of a single HEV configuration, the  proposed  framework  is  utilized  to  implement  EMSs  of different  types  of  HEVs.  It  is  not able  that  this  method  can significantly shorten the EMS development cycle for different types  of  HEVs.  
 * We  also  study  TL  between  EMSs  with different  control  variables.  Interestingly  the  results  show  that the  learning  efficiency  of  an  EMS  that  controls  engine  and motor  can  be  improved  by  knowledge  reuse  from  an  EMS that only controls engine.
