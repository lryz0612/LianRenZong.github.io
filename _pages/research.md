## Rule-interposing deep reinforcement learning based energy management strategy for power-split hybrid electric vehicle.[DOI](https://reader.elsevier.com/reader/sd/pii/S0360544220304047?token=B70E6384D7093CAEC7BC9C8D4E005696F260B15D5BC83F0E1349CD2D82DE1F5111D6000746121629006098B3A4FF2BB5) & [Code](https://github.com/lryz0612/Deep-reinforcement-learning-based-energy-management-strategy-for-hybrid-electric-vehicle)

* A rule-interposing deep reinforcement learning based energy management system is proposed based on a state-of-art DRL algorithm, DDPG; 
* Aiming at the fuel economy and learning efficiency of DRL-based EMS, the embedded knowledge is utilized to solve the multi-objective optimization problem and the simplification of large control space; 
* Extensive comparative simulations with respect to rule-interposing (RI) DDPG-based EMS and RI DQL-based EMS are conducted and discussed in detail.
