[**Understanding semantic similarity among subway stations using smart card data**](https://zhuangdingyi.github.io/files/Final report for Prof. Lee.pdf) 
*National University of Singapore, July. 2018~ Sept. 2018*  
*Advisors*: [Prof. Lee Der-Horng](http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/people/ceeleedh/), Dr. Siyu Hao, [Prof. Jiangang Jin](http://naoce.sjtu.edu.cn/en/teachershow.aspx?info_lb=24&info_id=8&flag=2)  
  * Proposed a new conception to understand metropolitan mobility as words  
  * Independently selected mobility features then trained stacked autoencoder network to discover mobility semantics  
  * Applied topic modeling (TF-IDF+SVD+LDA) on scraped POI data to find service semantics 
  * Geodata visualization with Python 
  * A working paper is under construction
